          XYZ School was established in 1991 AD through the initiative of
          academicians, intellectuals, and social workers residing in the
          Kuleshwor area. For over three decades, the institution has been
          providing exceptional educational services, distinguishing itself as a
          pioneering academic establishment. In its ongoing pursuit of quality
          enhancement, the school achieved a significant milestone by receiving
          formal Quality Assurance and Accreditation  certification from
          the University Grants Commission. As the first QAA-certified
          institution in the Kathmandu Valley, XYZ School has been accelerating
          its progress with the support, guidance, and supervision of the UGC,
          along with the active participation of its esteemed stakeholders.
          <br /> <br />
           As a
          non-profit community institution, XYZ School is dedicated to serving
          the people, society, and the nation by delivering quality education.
          Notable features of the school include a conducive academic
          environment, mutual understanding, high regard for social values, and
          practice-based learning. Despite modest initial investments, the
          school has maintained high educational standards due to the dedication
          and commitment of its students, faculty members, and management. Since
          its establishment, XYZ School has promoted inclusive education by
          offering scholarships to socially marginalized, economically
          disadvantaged, differently-abled, and meritorious students.
          <br /> <br />
           The
          institution prioritizes the optimal use of available resources to
          foster academic excellence. Over the years, XYZ School has acquired
          approximately 2,200 square meters of land and constructed a four-story
          building equipped with modern learning facilities. The expansion of
          physical infrastructure has been made possible through the continuous
          support of the UGC, as well as contributions from the management
          committee, faculty, and non-teaching staff. The school’s overarching
          vision is to evolve into a deemed university in the foreseeable
          future, guiding its mission and growth.
